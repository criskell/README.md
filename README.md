# Hi, I'm criskell


I'm a 19-year-old software developer with expertise in the PHP and JS realms, including:

- Laravel
- WooCommerce and WordPress
- Magento 1 and 2
- NodeJS
- React, Relay, Next.js
- MongoDB

Inspired by Richard Feynman's philosophy of "What I cannot create, I do not understand," I enjoy recreating technologies from scratch as a hobby, delving into their inner workings to gain a deeper understanding.

My goal is to make significant contributions through code and writing, benefiting both my clients and the broader community.
